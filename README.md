## Short Description:
Our application allows users to quickly search for pokemon and basic information about that pokemon including their images. 
You can search the pokemon by name, id, type, moves, evolutionary stages, and other queries. Our users are pokemon players or
people who are interested in pokemon. Specific features we will have are the ability to "catch" pokemon and save them into a pokedex.
Moreover, you can quickly see the pokemon's evolutionary stages as well. You can also quickly switch between the different evolution stages. 

## List of libraries, frameworks, and APIs we will use:

We are planning to use PokeAPI, Bootstrap, REACT JS, webpacks (potentially).
